                    Stock Market Highlights: Nifty pullback rally may continue.

                    While recouping most of Thursdayâ€™s loss, Nifty today ended
                    190 points higher to form a long bull candle on the daily
                    chart. The short-term trend of Nifty seems to have reversed
                    on the upside and the sustainability of this upside bounce
                    could be crucial to call this as an important bottom
                    reversal. Nifty is likely to move up further towards the
                    next overhead resistance of around 19230 levels. Any
                    weakness from here could find support around 18850 levels,
                    said Nagaraj Shetti of HDFC Securities. The maximum call
                    open interest strike of 19,000 saw call writers exiting and
                    put writers strengthening their positions, which is a
                    bullish sign.
